          Overview
        </div>
        <p>
          The first step to growing is sprouting the seed!
        </p>
        <p>
          Many people think that soil is required for plants to grow, but sprouting a seed requires only water and the right environment. Sprouts eventually grow into full-sized plants, but they can also be harvested early for a tasty and nutrient-filled snack!
        </p>
        <p>
          For this initial challenge, we will provide you with a kit that includes all the items and instructions you need to successfully grow sprouts.  Once you complete the challenge, you will have a tasty group of baby green sprouts that you can enjoy, and the confidence to complete this essential first step in growing!

          The Big Picture
        </div>
        <p>
          Why are we starting with sprouts?
        </p>
        <p>
          Although edible plants can be complex, sprouts are a great way to begin with the basics.  A sprout is a seed that has just barely begun to grow - a baby plant.  Since the baby plants are not photosynthesizing yet, they do not require sunlight at this stage.  This makes sprouting possible in a variety of environments, even in the dark!
        </p>
        <p>
          Growing sprouts does not require a lot of time or resources, but this activity will help you understand the fundamentals of germination (sprouting seeds) and get you in the habit of noticing how your plants are doing on a day-to-day basis.
